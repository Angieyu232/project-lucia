                    <h1>Who am I?</h1>
                    <p>I practice Spiritual Response Therapy along with extrasensory perception. Outside the spiritual world, I am a Buddhist and software engineer. Born in main land China, I immigrated to United States a couple years ago.</br>
                        As I followed the original SRT teaching and gradually adapted my own extrasensory into it, my communication with the otherside grows into a joined forms of vision, intuition, on top of the practical tools SRT provided (numbers and charts). </p>
                </div>
                <div class="topic-container">
                    <h1>What Do I offer?</h1>
                    <p>I offer free communication session with your High Self and Guardian Angels. (Your High Self is the divine espect of you; Every human being has a one or two Gurdian Angels.)</br>
                        There are plenty of mediums and clairvoyants out there capable of getting answers from a wide range of entities. A lot of them can explain messages to clients in the manner of a regular conversation flow. However that is not my approach, I rarely receive
                        direct human language. And I envy how effortless their mediumship seems.
                        </br>
                        Each session lasts about 20 minutes. You can ask them anything, see it as a Q&A session in which I function as a translator. As a session comes to an end, I type in the message and email the finalized transcript to you.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Out of safety concerns, I only connect to your High self and Guardian Angels. Unless I receive a strong affirmative from High self and Guardian Angles, I don't connect with any other spiritual entities.</li>
                        <li>For people with Privacy concerns, I can sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement at a cost of $20.</li>

                    <h1>What's the process like?</h1>
                    <p>To make things easier to understand, here is a <a class="flowchart-link" href="flowchart.html">flow chart</a></p>
                    <p>Notes: In the diagram, I use <b>HS</b> as acronym for High Self, and <b>GA</b> as acronym of Guardian Angels</p>
                </div>
                <div class="topic-container">
                    <h2>Further explaination of the process</h2>
                    <p>As you can see in the flow chart, translating energies and architypal symbols into human friendly language is not a stream-lined process. During the information gathering phase, I mix terminologies and describe an issue from multiple
                        perspectives. So that the complexity of the message are less likely to be compromise. It requires trials and errors in order to improve accuracy.
                        </br>People interpret the same words differently. One might feel emotionally charged towards a particular phrase while another feels complete neutral. Words are just a carrier, content is what really matters.</p>

                <div class="topic-container">
                    <h1>Why do I only connect with high self committes?</h1>
                    <p>Long stroy short, High Self committes is a group of spiritual entities that are guruanteed to look out to your highest good. They always brings you closer to your soul purpose. While a lot of other spiritual entities have agendas that
                        won't benefit to you.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="topic-container">
                    <h1>Why do I offer session for free?</h1>
                    <ul>
                        <li>My translation process lacks the "authoratative aura" most professional medium have. I rarely get answers in one trail, it's a continuous fine-tuning process.</li>
                        <li>I don't guarantee anything except for my translation will be as neutral as possible.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>What do i get out of it?</h2>
                    <p>Translating accurately with simple yet consice language is a skill I'd like to further develop. I'm glad to help someone while improving my own skills.</p>
